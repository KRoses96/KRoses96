## <u>Personal projects I'm working on:</u>

### Solidworks Web Integration:

I'm working on creating a way to interact with Solidworks models through the web. This involves setting up a server with Solidworks that queues model changes and automates schematics generation.

### Label system:

The prototype for this project is complete! It‚Äôs an app for creating label templates. I‚Äôm considering moving from Tkinter to PyQt5 for the next phase before making the repo public. (Or maybe just refactor it to an Electron app)

### [Hop(ongoing)](https://github.com/hopwithfriends):

Hop is a multiplayer browser web app that lets you interact with a browser in a co-op fashion. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on improving our Dockerfile for the VNC.

### [Factojet(ongoing)](https://github.com/KRoses96/factojet):

Factojet aims to streamline work organization within a factory using a simple, automated approach. The prototype is done, but I‚Äôm working on enhancing the algorithm and adding tools to the equation.
