# Heyo ðŸ¥² 

I do some typeScript, python, rust and whatever sledgehammer is needed to fix the problem.

## Must-Have for Every Project
ðŸš€ npm i [is-ten-thousand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ten-thousand)  
ðŸ’– npm i [uwuifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uwuifier)  
ðŸ§  npm i [oneplusone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oneplusone)

## What I Actually Do
- Glue things together and pretend it's magic
- Integrate APIs, services, and sometimes completely unrelated tech
- Automate the boring stuff so I can nap more
- Occasionally write Rust just to suffer

### Bye!
